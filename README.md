# Raytracing in One Weekend
Mostly following the [book](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley using whatever cursed amalgamation of modern C++ features I feel like.

Here's a kinda low quality version of the final scene (and the cover of the book) since I couldn't be bothered to wait long enough with a hot laptop for a higher quality render:

I also made it run on multiple threads because even the lower quality render above took a long time (~10 mins on 10 cores).
